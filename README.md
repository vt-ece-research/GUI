# GUI

The purpose of the GUI is to make MOSAIC more user friendly by giving the command line a graphical interface to interact with. This is accomplished by the GUI acting as a client program similar to port2port client.py. There are some changes from client.py. These changes include _not_ recieving as a loop. Communication is done entirely after the press of the "send command" button. 

The GUI immediately connects to the server as soon as the GUI is run.
